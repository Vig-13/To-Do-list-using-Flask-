# To-Do-list-using-Flask-
This is a simple To-Do List Web App built using Flask and SQLite. It allows users to add, update, and delete tasks with a title and description. Each task can be marked as complete or incomplete. The app uses SQLAlchemy ORM to manage the database and stores tasks in a local SQLite database (users.db).
